yTunes
======

###All the songs you want, powered by the Youtube API



Built for Hack n Roll 2013 @ NUS COM1 Basement in less than 24 hours.

yTunes is a minimal music service web app, in the same spirit of Spotify and Rdio.
You can listen to, curate, and share your favourite music instantly without hassle.

This is the raw, unedited version of the app built over the period of the hackathon.
