Built for [Hack n Roll 2013](http://hacknroll.nushackers.org/) @ NUS COM1 Basement in less than 24 hours.

yTunes is a minimal music service web app, in the same spirit of Spotify and Rdio.
You can listen to, curate, and share your favourite music instantly without hassle.
Try it out [here](http://leventhan.github.com/yTunes).

This is the raw, unedited version of the app built over the period of the hackathon.
